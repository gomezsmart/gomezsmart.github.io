With the Snipping Tool, you can select the part of your screen that you would like to take a screenshot of.</p><p>Third, if any of the above methods don’t work, you can also use a standalone screenshot utility. These utilities usually provide more options for taking screenshots, such as capturing a region of the screen, and are easy to use.</p><p>So there you have it - three easy ways to take screenshots on your Lenovo Chromebook without the Windows key. With any of these methods, you’ll be able to take effective screenshots quickly and easily.</p><h3 id=2-shortcut-keys-for-screenshots>2. Shortcut Keys for Screenshots<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-shortcut-keys-for-screenshots>#</a></h3><p>Taking a screenshot on a Lenovo Chromebook without a Windows key can sound like a tricky task, but it’s actually quite easy. All you need to do is press the Ctrl and the window switch key at the same time. This will capture what’s currently on the display and store it as an image file. You can then edit the image to your preferences or even just save it for future reference. To view the saved image, it is best to open the files app and click on ‘Downloads’. Here you will find the image that was just taken.</p><p>For more specific screenshot needs, there are a few other methods you can use. For example, if you want to capture only a portion of the screen, you can press the Ctrl, Shift, and the window switch key at the same time. This will allow you to select an area of the screen to capture. After that, you can edit it or save it just like the full-screen screenshot.</p><p>Another option is to take a screenshot of a specific window. To do this hold down the Alt and the window switch key while the target window is selected. This will capture only the selected window and the remaining screen will be blurred out. Once you’ve got the screenshot saved, you can edit it accordingly.</p><p>Finally, if you want to take a delayed screenshot to give you more time to prepare the screen, you can press the Ctrl, Alt, and the window switch key. This will open a timer that you can set for up to 10 seconds. When the timer finishes, it will take the screenshot and save it to the downloads folder for you to view and edit.</p><p>These are just a few of the ways you can take a screenshot on a Lenovo Chromebook without a Windows key. With some practice and a bit of patience, you’ll be able to master the perfect screenshot.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2GdJbgw8Vg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is a Chromebook?</p><p>A1: A Chromebook is a laptop or tablet running the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system.
