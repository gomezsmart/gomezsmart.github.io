Connect the Two Phones Via Bluetooth<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-connect-the-two-phones-via-bluetooth>#</a></h3><p>Transferring data from one phone to the other used to be quite a hassle, but with modern technology, it can be done quickly and easily. To transfer data from Android to Android with Bluetooth, turn on Bluetooth on both devices and pair them together. Now that they&rsquo;ve been paired, open the file you wish to transfer. Select the share button and then select the paired device. Confirm the transfer on the target phone and the file will transfer via Bluetooth. To transfer multiple files per session, select them all and hit the share button. The files will be transferred in a single batch. Lastly, disconnect the two devices from each other when done. This will make sure your data is secure and no longer shared.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPsdmiGd3WU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is the easiest way to transfer files from one Android phone to another?
