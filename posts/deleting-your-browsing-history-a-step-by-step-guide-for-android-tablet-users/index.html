Here are some helpful tips to help you secure your browsing history on a Android tablet.</p><p>First, use a secure web browser and turn on the ‘Do Not Track’ feature. This will prevent websites from tracking your activities online and sending unwanted cookies to your device.</p><p>Second, clear your browsing data often. This includes cookies, cached files, and history. This can be done in the settings menu of your browser app.</p><p>Third, enable the ‘Incognito’ mode on browsers like Google Chrome. This will prevent your browser from saving your browsing data while surfing the web.</p><p>Finally, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) when accessing public Wifi networks. This will encrypt your data and keep it safe from prying eyes.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQaUrLhxZJ0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is the purpose of deleting your browsing history from an Android tablet?
