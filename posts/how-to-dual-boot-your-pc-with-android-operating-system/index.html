The first step is to install a virtual machine, which is a software application that creates an environment to install and run any operating system. The next step is to validate the computer&rsquo;s boot menu and enable it to boot from the CD/DVD device. Once the boot menu is enabled, the Android OS installation disc can be inserted into the optical drive. After the disc is detected by the computer, it will automatically start installing the Android OS. The user can choose the level of customization during the setup process. Finally, the installation process is completed and the Android OS will be ready to use.</p><h3 id=2-setting-up-a-dual-boot-system>2. Setting up a Dual Boot System<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-setting-up-a-dual-boot-system>#</a></h3><p>Installing Android OS on a PC in a dual boot configuration is an excellent way to get the best of both worlds. In order to do this, you need to partition your hard disk drive into two partitions, one for the primary operating system and one for the Android operating system. Then, you need to insert a USB drive that has the appropriate Android OS installation files. After that, you need to choose the USB drive as the primary boot device. Lastly, you need to accept the license agreement and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Once the installation is completed, your PC is now ready to run both Windows and Android operating systems.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbT6sT06oHM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is a dual boot PC?</p><p>A1: A dual boot PC is a computer that is able to run two different operating systems (OS) simultaneously.
