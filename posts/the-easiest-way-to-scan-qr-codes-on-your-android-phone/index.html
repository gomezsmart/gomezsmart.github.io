Scanning a QR Code<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-scanning-a-qr-code>#</a></h3><p>QR codes can be easily scanned using an Android phone. You can find these codes in magazines, on restaurant menus, and even on products in stores. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to scan a QR code on an Android phone.
First, open the camera app on your Android device. Then, point the camera at the QR code that you want to scan. The phone should recognize the QR code and display a notification alert. Once you receive the notification, you can click on it to open the link associated with the code.
To make sure that you can scan a QR code properly, make sure that there is enough light in the area and that the code is not too far away. Additionally, if the code is on a printed surface, try to keep it as flat as possible to ensure proper scanning.
Finally, when scanning a QR code, make sure that you don’t accidentally open a malicious link. Before clicking on the link, make sure that it is from a trusted source. If you feel unsure of a link, do not open it.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjHZfW5orOU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q : What is the easiest way to scan QR codes on an Android phone?
