Additionally, ensure enough free storage space on the iPhone to accommodate the transfer. Finally, it is also important to back up the Android device to avoid any data loss during the transfer process. With these basic steps in mind, users can easily transfer data from Android to iPhone using the Move to iOS app.\n3. 7 Easy Steps to Transfer Data from Android to iPhone via Reddit Are you a Reddit user wanting to switch from Android to iPhone?
