How to find the screenshot you have taken<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-how-to-find-the-screenshot-you-have-taken>#</a></h2><p>Toshiba Satellite laptops come with Windows 10 and can be used to take screenshots quickly and easily. The Print Screen button is all that&rsquo;s needed to capture the entire screen; however, if you want to take a screenshot of just one window, you can use the Alt + Print Screen keys instead. Once you&rsquo;ve taken the screenshot, it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious where it&rsquo;s saved. To find your screenshot, open the Pictures folder located in your User Home folder, then the Screenshots folder inside that. The screenshot you just took should be the most recently added image in the folder. If you need to move or rename the image, you can do so from this folder. Taking screenshots on your Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 10 is easy and the process is the same regardless of the laptop&rsquo;s size or model.</p><h3 id=1-locating-the-screenshots>1.
