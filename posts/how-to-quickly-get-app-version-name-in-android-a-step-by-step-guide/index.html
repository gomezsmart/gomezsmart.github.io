To make sure that your app always has the right version name, it must be quickly and easily obtained. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to get the App Version Name in Android.\nFirst, open the Manifest file in your Android project. Here, you will find a versionName tag, which includes the version code and name for your app. Then, add a ‘versionName’ attribute to the Manifest tag in the file. This should include a short version code and name for your app.\nNext, open the Gradle build file in your Android project. This file should contain the version name and code. You can then use the following command to obtain the version name and code: android.defaultConfig.versionName. This command will return the version name and code of your app.\nFinally, you can use the versionName attribute to retrieve the version name and code of your app. You can find the versionName attribute in both the Manifest file and Gradle build file. To obtain the version name and code, you just need to use the appropriate command.\nBy following these steps, you can quickly and easily get the version name and code of your Android app. This is a simple and efficient way to keep your app running smoothly and up-to-date.\n1. Understanding Android App Version Name Android app version name is the version number assigned to the application by its developer. It typically consists of four parts - major version, minor version, patch level and build number. The major version is increased when there are drastic changes to the application. The minor version is increased when the changes are of a smaller scale, and the patch level and build numbers are increased when bug fixes are applied. Knowing the version name helps to detect if there is an upgrade available for the app.\nIn order to get the version name, you can check the app’s manifest XML file or query the Package Manager programmatically. To get the version name from the manifest XML, access the package name and look for the versionName attribute. To get it programmatically, use the getPackageInfo() method of Package Manager and access the versionName.\nIt is also possible to get the application version code, which is a more accurate number to identify the changes in an app. The version code is an integer value assigned to the app, and this is the primary version control number used by developers. You can get this code from the versionCode attribute of the XML or programmatically using the getPackageInfo() method of the Package Manager.\nTherefore, knowing the version name and version code of an application can help you to determine if there is an update available or if the application is running the latest version.\n2. Find App Version Name in Android Android app version name is a string that is used to track the version of the app. It provides the user with information about the features of the current version of the app. It helps developers to keep track of the changes made in the application. Knowing the version name of the app can also help the users to understand the latest features they can explore. Moreover, it also helps the app to stay compatible with different versions of Android. In order to get the version name of an Android app, one can either use the Android Debug Bridge Command Line tool or the package manager. Both of these methods are easy to use and can provide the version name of the app quickly.\n- Step-by-Step Guide to Get App Version Name Getting an app version name is a very useful and necessary task in Android app development, but it can be confusing and difficult to do. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to get the version name of an app. This step-by-step guide will provide instructions on how to quickly get the app version name in Android.\nFirstly, open Android Studio and you can find the version name in the app’s module-level build.gradle file. It should be in the form of: versionName 1.0.0. Secondly, open the app’s gradle.properties file and look for the versionName property. The value assigned to it is the version name of the app.\nThirdly,check the applicationId of the app. The version name is part of the applicationId. The string after the last colon in the applicationId is the version name. Lastly, create a command-line script to get the version name of the app. This is a bit more involved, but it is much more powerful as you can automate the process and get the version name of an app programmatically.\nBy following this step-by-step guide, it should be a lot easier to get the app version name in Android.\n1. Finding the App Version Name Getting the version name of an app in android can be a tricky process. With this step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to learn how to get the version name of a given android app in no time. First of all, you need to create a new project in the android studio. Once the project is created, open the app-level build.gradle file. Here, you can easily find the version name and version code. Both the version name and version code should be visible in the Gradle Scripts. Another way to find the version name is by going to the ‘Build’ menu and selecting ‘Generate Signed Bundle/APK’. After that, you can find the app’s version name and version code on the ‘Signing’ tab in the next window. Lastly, you can find the version name and version code by opening the ‘about’ section of the app. It should be visible on the main page of the app. With this easy guide, you’ll be able to quickly check the version name of any app in your android device.\n2. Updating the App Version Name Are you wondering how to get the app version name in android? If yes, then this guide is especially made for you. This guide will provide you with the step-by-step procedure to get the app version name in android. First of all, open the app and open the main project in the Android Studio. Then, go to the module-level build.gradle file and look for the version identifier. It should be something like ‘versionName’. Finally, add the version name as a parameter that you can use in your code. With that, you have now successfully found the app version name in android.\n- Wrapping up Wrapping up, we now know how to quickly get the version name of an Android application. To do this, we first referenced the versionName attribute in our gradle.build file, then we retrieved the packageInfo from our context and used it to get the version name. After that, we made the version name string available in our activity by assigning it to a TextView. With all of these steps completed, we now have a reliable way to get version name of our Android application.\n1. Retrieve App Version Name Wrapping up, it is easy to get the app version name in Android. There are few simple steps to follow to retrieve the version code and version name. First, you need to create an instance of PackageManager in your current activity, then call getPackageInfo method to get the package info. Finally, you can get the version name and code from the package info. It is important to remember that the minSdkVersion in your app gradle should be greater than or equal to the version code you’re trying to get. Doing so will ensure your app is backwards compatible and will perform optimally for all users.\n2. Wrapping Up Wrapping up is an important part in creating a successful mobile application. After creating your app, you need to make sure that your users have the most up-to-date version of it. One of the best ways to do this is to get the version name of the app in Android.

First, you need to create an instance of PackageManager in your current activity, then call getPackageInfo method to get the package info. Finally, you can get the version name and code from the package info.

Additionally, you can view the version name in the Play Store to make sure that all of your users have the same version. After you have the version name, you can use that information to create a better user experience and give your customers a better quality product.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2Np-m4215M style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
