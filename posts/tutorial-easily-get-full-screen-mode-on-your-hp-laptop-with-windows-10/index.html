Exploring the Benefits of Full Screen Mode on HP Laptop with Windows 10<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-exploring-the-benefits-of-full-screen-mode-on-hp-laptop-with-windows-10>#</a></h3><p>Full screen mode on a HP laptop running Windows 10 provides a few advantages for users. Whether you&rsquo;re using Windows 10 for the first time or you&rsquo;re upgrading from an earlier version, using full screen mode can give you a larger workspace and a better view of your documents. Here are some of the benefits of using full screen mode on a HP laptop with Windows 10.</p><p>The first benefit of full screen mode is the additional space provided to work on tasks. Rather than having to use multiple windows on the computer screen, everything can be accessed within a single screen.

When a window is maximized, it typically expands to fit the entire screen, allowing the user to easily scroll up and down the display. This can be helpful when trying to find specific files or folders without having to resize a window.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAWPtt9gD5A style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is full screen mode?
