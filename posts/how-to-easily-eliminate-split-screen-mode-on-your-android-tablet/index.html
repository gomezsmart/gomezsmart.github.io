Troubleshoot Android System to Resolve Split Screen Issues<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-troubleshoot-android-system-to-resolve-split-screen-issues>#</a></h3><p>Split screen issues on Android tablets can be annoying, but resolving them doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult. Here are some additional tips and tricks to help you get rid of the split screen issue on your tablet.</p><p>First, double check your tablet&rsquo;s settings and ensure that you have only one app open at a time.

This can help close any open apps and clear out any memory issues that may be causing the split-screen problem.</p><p>Third, you can try using the ‘recent apps’ button to close any apps that may be causing the issue. This button is usually found on the bottom left side of your tablet.</p><p>Finally, if the above tips don&rsquo;t work, you may need to do a factory reset of your tablet. This should restore it to its original settings and resolve any split-screen issue. However, make sure you backup your data before doing this, as any data stored on the tablet will be lost.</p><h3 id=2-utilizing-third-party-apps-to-reduce-split-screen-issues>2.
