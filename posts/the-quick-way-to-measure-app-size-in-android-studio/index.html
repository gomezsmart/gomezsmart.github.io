Measuring App Size in Android Studio<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-measuring-app-size-in-android-studio>#</a></h3><p>Measuring app size in Android Studio can be painless, with the right tools. Android Studio provides the APK Analyzer for measuring the total size of an app. This tool is available in Android Studio 3.0 and higher. To use it, select the app module from the project view in Android Studio and then select your APK from the build/output/apks folder. After that, you can see your app&rsquo;s size in the APK Analyzer.</p><p>In addition to the APK Analyzer, Android Studio also provides a tool to measure the size of your app against Google Play&rsquo;s target size standards. This tool is available in Android Studio 3.2 and higher, and can be accessed by selecting Analyze > App Size from the menu. Here, you can compare your app size to the target size limits set by Google Play and identify potential opportunities for reducing the size of your app.</p><p>Finally, there are other tools available to measure app size in Android Studio. The Gradle plugin for Android, for instance, provides a way to identify APK size issues, such as duplicate files, unused code, and other sources of wasted space. You can also use the ProGuard tool to detect and eliminate unused code that increases your APK size.</p><p>Measuring app size in Android Studio can be a simple process with the right tools. The APK Analyzer and other Android Studio tools can provide valuable insights into your app&rsquo;s size, and help you identify potential areas for reducing the size of your app.</p><h2 id=3-conclusion>3.
